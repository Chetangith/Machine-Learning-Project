# Machine-Learning-Project
This Employee Attrition problem is an supervised machine learning problem, build to predict the salary of employee.  For this prediction problem we build different
models & after checking the training, test Accuracy, r2_score &  Metrices (MSE, RMSE, MAE) of each model we conclude that "Gradient Boosting Regressor" model perform 
well compared to all the other models.
This model able to predict the salary of employee very well training score 75.30%, test score 75.20% and r2_score 75% for this model.  
If the salary given to the employee less than predicted salary this may be the probable reason for employee to leave an organization & to avoid this we comes to the 
conclusion that we can increase the salary of the employee if they have required degree &  years of experience,  we also provide them with good accomodation & 
better working environment. so they would be happy with our organization.. !!
